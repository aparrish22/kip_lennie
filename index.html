            <dd>
              <strong class="kip-name">Kip</strong> is pretty laid back and chills most of the time. Kip loves spending time with
              his brother Lennie and often times he will take a nap or rest beside
              you. And Kip has the cutest, little meow ever! So high-pitched!

          <dt>Lennie's Personality</dt>
            <dd>
              <strong class="lennie-name">Lennie</strong> is the bane of our existence. He's cute and all, but he is an
              absolute <em>annoyance</em> in the morning. Usually he will meow pretty loud 
              to get food whenever he wants. However, Lennie is an absolute
              monster when he gets our attention in the mornings to satiate his
              hunger. He will crawl up onto us in bed and meow louder than any other
              speciman alive! He will rub his body and head against our head... and
              maybe he will attempt to claw or paw us on the face just to wake us
              up and get our attention so he can get his food!<br /><br />Fun fact: He's missing the tip of his tail.
